 - You'll need hacking skills, no Game of Thrones knowledge is required. But if you play, it may contains spoilers of the TV series
 - Difficulty of the CTF: Medium-High
 - Don't forget to take your map (try to find it). It will guide you about the natural flag order to follow over the kingdoms
 - Listen CAREFULLY to the hints. If you are stuck, read the hints again!
 - Powerful fail2ban spells were cast everywhere. Bruteforce is not an option for this CTF (2 minutes ban penalty)
 - The flags are 32 chars strings. Keep'em all! you'll need them
 - It's supposed that you don't have physical access to the machine. Don't try to cheat. The challenge is to hack it through the network services

**Requirements/starting guide**:

 - Import the Linux based CTF challenge virtual machine (OVA file)
 - OVA file is compatible with Oracle Virtualbox and Vmware
 - The challenge vm needs 1 cpu and 1512mb RAM to work properly
